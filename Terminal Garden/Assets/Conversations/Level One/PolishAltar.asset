  - Mr. Raccoon:Clean the church? Yeah I have something for you
  - 'Mr. Raccoon:I think I have a cleanser from the gardener. '
  - 'Mr. Raccoon:Huh the church used to be full of people '
  - "Mr. Raccoon:And now no one is going to. Because we don\u2019t need to anymore.
    Only the gardener cleans it regularly. "
  - "Mr. Raccoon:It was supposed to be his work but after he got sick and\u2026uhh
    lots things happened."
  - Mr. Raccoon:Anyway, just take the cleanser from me when you're ready.
